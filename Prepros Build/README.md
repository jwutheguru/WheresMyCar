# WheresMyCar
Simple experimental program to find the direction to a saved location. 
This project was mainly meant to test out HTML Geolocation API, and also maybe help me find my car.

## Status
Currently a Work-in-Progress.

## Note
Due to inaccuracies in GPS location (especially if not on a mobile device), the distances could be way off.
Am looking into better ways.
